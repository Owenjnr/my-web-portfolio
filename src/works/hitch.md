### HITCH

#### Overview

The "HITCH" Project was one of my most remarkable project working within a cross-functional team of marketers, designers, data & network engineers and developers. It gave me the opportunity to learn so much about laravel frameworks, Openwrt, bitbucket pipelines, git, PHP, javascript, mesh technologies, tv white space, internet-of-things and many others. 

HITCH is a solution that was birthed because broadband demand for video delivery and other services is exploding globally. Telcoâ€™s/Service providers struggle to maintain legacy systems, and upgrades to emerging technologies at a pace that matches deployment and maintenance; as well as extend coverage to underserved users in various markets. However, for rural populations, broadband for video supply is simply unavailable, unaffordable and inaccessible. Flexifinity media developed HITCH a cloud platform that enables the curation and access to videos via a HITCH-designed (smart) WiFi hotspot that caches content, and lets users access it offline.

HITCH forms WIFI Data Hubs or HITCH spots enabling users to affordably store and stream videos and other internet contents, talk/chat with each other, and access more internet information without a need for individual data connection.
