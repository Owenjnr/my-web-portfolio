#### Overview

The Spa Lagos website is a freelance eCommerce project developed and completed for Koana Consulting. clients will be able to book appointments, select staff according to needs, choose time and place as well as pay online for the purchased service. It was an amazing learning experience considering it was the first time using Elementor and Wordpress. It gave a refresing experience, most especially with SEO implementation, design options and open creativity. It gave me the freelance to meet and go beyond client expectation.
